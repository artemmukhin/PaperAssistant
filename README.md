# PaperAssistant
PaperAssistant is a photo assistant for students based on a paper detector. It is currently available only for Android. PaperAssistant takes photos from your phone, picks out only the paper photos (books, workbooks, notes), and move it to individual folder.

Our paper detector uses OpenCV to calculate color histograms and find contours in the images.

This app has been developed on SPbSU Emerging Technologies Hackathon on April 28-29, 2017 by Pusto Glavnaya Team.
Teammates: Gleb Zakharov, Ekaterina Bulanina, Artem Mukhin.
